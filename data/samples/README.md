# data/samples — real GRACE-FO Level-1B products (test oracles)

Five RL04 ASCII products of **2020-01-01, GRACE-C** from PO.DAAC
(https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/GRACE-FO), taken over unchanged from the owner's
predecessor toolbox (`NonGravToolbox/data/samples`, 2026-08-01):

| File | Records | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `ACT1B_2020-01-01_C_04.txt` | 600 (first 10 min) | calibrated linear + angular accelerations, SRF |
| `GNV1B_2020-01-01_C_04.txt` | 600 (first 10 min) | position and velocity, Earth-fixed (`coord_ref = E`) |
| `SCA1B_2020-01-01_C_04.txt` | 600 (first 10 min) | star-camera quaternions ICRF→SRF, scalar first |
| `THR1B_2020-01-01_C_04.txt` | 471 (complete day) | thruster activations (on-times per thruster, ms) |
| `MAS1B_2020-01-01_C_04.txt` | 24 (complete day) | cold-gas TANK masses (~15 kg per tank) — NOT spacecraft mass |

The three 1 Hz products are the first 600 records of the day with `num_records`
rewritten to 600; every data line is as published. MAS1B and THR1B are
byte-identical to `gracefoReading/tests/realdata`.

These files are the oracle of `tests/tNgfIo.m` (HANDOVER Part I, 2026-09-06).
Replacing an excerpt with the full-day file needs no code change: readers and
tests read record counts from the file. Tests never skip when a file is
missing; they fail, because a skipped test is not evidence.
