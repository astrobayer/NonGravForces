# NonGravForces 0.5.1

Non-gravitational forces, torques and partials for LEO satellites (GRACE-FO reference case). Third concept, designed from scratch after the audits of `SatelliteNonGravToolbox` v1 and `NonGravToolbox` v0.1.1.

* Specification and plan: `HANDOVER.md` (single source of truth)
* Theory and implementation: `doc/NonGravForces_Theory_and_Implementation.pdf`
* Help browser: `setupNonGravForces`, then `doc NonGravForces`

```matlab
run('../referenceSystem/setupReferenceSystem.m'); run('../gracefoReading/setupGraceFOReading.m')
setupNonGravForces; runNgfTests
```
Status: L0, geometry (GRACE-FO macro model) and qc.hampel/eventTable implemented and verified in MATLAB; all other units are documented stubs.
